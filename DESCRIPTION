Package: RJSONIO
Version: 1.0-0
Title: Serialize R objects to JSON, JavaScript Object Notation
Description: This is a package that allows conversion to and from 
  data in Javascript object notation (JSON) format.
  This allows R objects to be inserted into Javascript/ECMAScript/ActionScript code
  and allows R programmers to read and convert JSON content to R objects.
  This is an alternative to rjson package. That version was too slow for converting large R objects to JSON
  and is not extensible, but a very useful prototype.  It is fast for parsing.
  This package uses methods, vectorized operations and C code and callbacks to R functions
  for deserializing JSON objects to R. 
  Verison 0.4 of this package uses a new native parser, implements the transformation code
  in C and allocates memory efficiently (rather than concatenating because of event driven parsing).
  The result is a significantly faster parsing of large JSON documents.
Note: The C code comes from www.json.org and is licensed under essentially the BSD license.
      See the notice in src/JSON_parser.c
      The libjson code is on sourceforge.net, but does not yet have a license.     
Note:  See http://www.json.org/JSON_checker/test.zip for tests.
   We now use code from the libjson project (http://libjson.sourceforge.net).
