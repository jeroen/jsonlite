Description: This package is a fork of the RJSONIO package by Duncan Temple
    Lang. It builds on the same libjson c++ parser, but implements a smarter
    mapping between JSON data and R classes. The vignette describes
    the behavior in great detail. In addition to drop-in replacements for
    toJSON and fromJSON, the package contains funtions to validate, prettify
    and minify JSON, and many unit tests to verify that all edge cases 
    are encoded and decoded consistently for use with dynamic data in systems
    and applications.
Suggests:
    testthat,
    knitr,
    reshape2,
    httr (>= 0.3),
    rjson
