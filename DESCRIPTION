Description: A fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data and
    the web. Started out as a fork of RJSONIO, but has been completely rewritten
    in recent versions. The package offers flexible, robust, high performance
    tools for working with JSON in R and is particularly powerful for building
    pipelines and interacting with web APIs. The parser implementation is based
    on the mapping described in the vignette of the package (Ooms, 2014). In
    addition to drop-in replacements for toJSON and fromJSON, jsonlite contains
    functions to stream, validate, and prettify JSON data, and many unit
    tests to verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded consistently
    for use with dynamic data in systems and applications.

    knitr,
    reshape2,
    httr (>= 0.4),
    rjson,
    plyr,
    curl
