Description: A fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data
    and the web. Started out as a fork of RJSONIO, but has been completely
    rewritten in recent versions. The package offers flexible, robust, high
    performance tools for working with JSON in R and is particularly powerful
    for building pipelines and interacting with web APIs. The implementation is
    based on the mapping described in the vignette of the package (Ooms, 2014).
    In addition to drop-in replacements for toJSON and fromJSON, jsonlite
    contains functions to stream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit
    tests included with the package verify that all edge cases are encoded and
    decoded consistently for use with dynamic data in systems and applications.
Suggests:
    curl (>= 0.5),
    reshape2,
    testthat,
    knitr,
    httr,
    rjson,
    plyr
